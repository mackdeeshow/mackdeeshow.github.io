 As he approaches the threshold of middle age, Mackenzie Dylan looks like a guy who has it all. He's smart, funny and handsome. He's well respected as a successful New York Daily News political columnist. He lives in a beautiful Manhattan apartment and has an inseparable -albeit neurotic- best friend. But Mack Dylan carries his share of baggage-a repressed childhood, an inability to express emotions, a failed engagement and a tendency not to deal with his disappointments. When life overwhelms Mackenzie Dylan that's when the 'real world' takes a station break and "The Mackenzie Dylan Show" goes on the air! "The Mackenzie Dylan Show" is the imaginary talk show 'broadcast' exclusively inside Mack's head! It's an irreverent, internal gabfest were the host puts his neurosis into perspective.
<p>
 Nothing is safe from Mackenzie's acerbic wit and pointed truth bearing observations on his guest panel. Pop culture, politics, social culture, his relationships, his distant father, his superficial, elitist mother as well as his over achieving ex-fiance are all queried to help him reveal what makes him tick!
<p>
 "The Mackenzie Dylan Show" is a proposed edgy original mini-series co-created by Vince Marino and Ted Pirro that is made up of 7 20-minute installments and 1 30 minute series finale. Each episode will juxtapose Mack's 'real world' with his 'TV talk show universe' including excerpts from the show featuring his monologues, sketches and soul searching interviews while deftly balancing comedy with pathos "The Mackenzie Dylan Show" is taking the initiative to be bold, original, thought provoking and very, very funny.

 Main and recurring Characters
<p>
 <b>Mackenzie Dylan</b> - the titular hero, in his late 30's Mack is everyone's "Guy's guy" smart, funny light and airy -quick with a  quip and fond of a shot of scotch (or 2) Mack is the quintessential "Dude" who has trouble embracing his "feminine" side or displaying emotions or closeness. His father was a hard ass military man who never validated his son's feelings or praised his achievements which created resentment and distance. This relationship also triggered his anti-establishment, rebellious and iconoclastic attitude.  His mother was a bigger role model with her artistic inclinations that she suppressed to favor her conservative husband.  With a tendency to engage in passive aggressive, manipulative behavior, Mrs. Dylan has sacrificed her idealism for social climbing elitism which has created a chasm between her and son. Mac uses his "Talk show" as an "inner dialogue" to deal with these issues.
<p>
 <b>Jim Gaborini</b> - Mac's life long best friend and partner in crime. In Mac's words "His Ethel Mertz". The self loathing "yang" to Mac's confident "Yin". "Gabbo" is in many ways Mac's opposite. Neurotic, insecure and prone to darker moods he is also brilliant and blessed with a biting wit. Unlike his compadre, "Gabbo" wears his emotions on his sleeve as he feels his life is unwinding due to a messy divorce and custody battle. His loyalty to his buddy remains unswerving.
<p>
 <b>Vanessa David</b> - Mac's "Announcer" and "2nd banana" on his "imaginary" talk show, Vanessa is the "projection" of the smart aleck girl who works behind the counter of the local pizzeria. She appears in sketches and generally provides comedic support. Her function in Mac's inner dialogue is to provide a rational counter to Mac's id. She's Paul Shaffer with great breasts.
<p>
 <b>Karen Mancini</b> - Mac's Ex-fiance -brainy, beautiful (a lawyer specializing in constitutional law for the ACLU) and just a general all around "Cool broad" (Mac's words). Mac has remained friends with Karen despite the failing of their relationship and the infrequency of interaction.  A palatable chemistry remains as well as mutual respect. Karen tolerates his self absorbed tendencies and idiosyncrasies but cannot stand his inability to open up emotionally. Mac has admitted to being intimidated by her intellectual independence from him and smothered by her emotional needs. Regardless, Karen is the true love of his life and has been his moral center.
<p>
 <b>Chris Nicolo</b> - In the "real world" Chris is the aspiring musician and over all cool guy who works as the doorman @ Mac's apartment. On "The Mackenzie Dylan Show" he's the 'musical director' and band leader as wellas an additional comic foil recruited for sketches.
<p>
 <b>Daniel Dylan</b> - Mac's over achieving older brother who casts a great shadow. Always favored by his parents, Dan did all the right things and never rocked the boat in the family exasperating Mac's status as the malcontent "black sheep of the family". A love/hate dynamic exists from Mac's perspective however he generally is respectful of his older sibling.
<p>
 As mentioned, the program will consist of 8 episodes; 7 20-minutes in length, (incorporating both the "real world" story line plus excerpts from the "talk show" - including monologue, key interview, sketches, band segues, musical guests, etc.) + 1 30-minute series finale. The talk show segments will correlate with the plot points of the real world segment s which usually center around one of his column topics.
<p>
 The Pilot episode will establish the series framework and characters.
<p>
 <b>Episode 1: UNEMPLOYED JESUS</b>
<p>
 Mack Dylan is in hot water. One of his columns criticizing the religious right and the inadequacy of religion has caused a fire storm - boycotts have been threatened causing our atheist inclined hero to stress. A Dinner with his Catholic inclined best friend Jim triggers a philosophical discussion that gets his pal heated. Mack "retreats" into his fantasy world and his "inner" talk show where his first guest is none other than Jesus Christ. Christ proves to be an open and revealing interview and displays a real good sense of humor as well.
<p>
<!--
 <b>Episode 2: ASSHOLE</b>
<p>
 Our Defender of free speech, Mackenzie Dylan finds himself unemployed ,untouchable and embroiled in controversy. Employment prospects are nil. In the words of his 'old school' agent, Marty, Mack's like "A leper with the ebola virus-no one will come near you." However, a beacon of hope shines from the most unlikely source -his estranged mentor Gene Sholtstien, the pretentious proprieter of  a liberal inclined satirical magazine. Twenty years ago, Mack exposed his "ethically challenged" sponsor at an awards banquet. Can these 2 alpha dogs bury their bones of contention? Mack works it out on the "talk show" in his mind along with guests Fidel Castro and Celebrity Comatose Terri Schivo!
<p>
 <b>Episode 3: MOTHER OF INVENTION</b>
<p>
 Police brutality against an unarmed African immigrant inspires a scathing "sketch" on Mack's inner "talk show" as well as reunites him with ex-fiance ACLU lawyer Karen who is handling the case. A less satisfying reunion is the one between Mack and his uber conservative and elitist Mother. Forced to connect for a dying relative, the complex and passive - aggressive nature of their relationship opens up old wounds and reveals a vulnerable side to Mack's detached demeanor. Naturally all these issues are projected on to the special "Mother's" edition of Mack's "Talk Show" featuring a personable panel of Ghengis Kahn, Rock Legend Jim Morrison , Return visitor Jesus Christ-and their Mothers!
<p>
 <b>Episode 4: DOMO ARRIGATO, BEBE REBOZZO</b>
<p>
Optimism is in the air: Mack's neurotic best friend Jim has found true love with earnest "performance artist/liberal activist" Bebe Rebozzo-and in the process turns kinky sex into an "art piece". Meanwhile a rejuvenated Mack is set to launch his own uncensored website and blog on HIS terms. But fate takes twisted turns for the lifelong friends including a development with Mac's ex Karen, an irate John McEnroe and a Murderous Gang of Heavy Metal Aborigones who attempt to high jack the imaginary "talk show".
<p>
<b>Episode 5: MATTERS OF THE HEART</b>
<p>
After a tense filled "intervention" conducted by  Karen and Mac's older brother Daniel, Mac uses the "Talk show" to evaluate his true feelings forhis former flame. An inspired Guest, Karen shares many memories of their relationship to the 'viewers' while opening her ex-fiances eyes to emotionally profound truths. Meanwhile, back  in the real world, Mac becomes privy to an incident that could sink the gubitorial campaign run by his brother as well as put him back on the journalistic map. Yet the weight of circumstances come into play, forcing Mac to make a difficult choice.
<p>
<b>Episode 6:  ON THE ROCKS</b>
<p>
Mac's sacrifice for Jim strangely receives the opposite reaction  which causes a rift between them  as Jim continues his personal spiral. Worse still, Mac's dad's life hangs in the balance after a massive heart attack which triggers uncharacteristic sentimentally towards his often remote  patriarch. These conflicting feelings are manifested on the "Talk show" - On Location from Mac's teenaged back yard where a poignant recollection penetrates an emotional barrier. Elsewhere, in the real world, Mac feels even more ostracized by his family but an amalgam of events leads to empathy from an unlikely source-Karen.
<p>
<b>Episode 7: DEWEY BEATS TRUMAN</b>
<p>
The penultimate episode begins with Mac stricken deliriously with the flu. This precipitates the recruitment of a "guest host" for the "talk show", Jim who proceeds to have an emotional breakdown "on screen". Recovered, Mac resumes his "hosting" duties  and presents the "Ted Haggard homosexual reconditioning boot camp" sketch. Back to reality, Mac's less successful confronting the self destructing Jim with a "tough love" stance - the fallout of which could close the door on their lifelong friendship.  Paradoxically , Mac stands at the threshold of strengthening another relationship due to unexpected events.
<p>
<b>Episode 8: FINALE</b>
<p>
This is it! The series finale where all the questions will be answered-but the answers will be questioned! As Mac becomes more alienated from his emotions, his real world and his fantasy world are spiraling toward a volatile collision! Will Mac survive the collateral damage? Can Mac repair the broken contacts with Jim? Will he reconcile his intimacy issues with Karen? Will Chris Nicolo's "tell all" book "sink" the "talk show"? Will Vanessa giving up weed lead to immigration reform? Will the finale end abruptly and cheesy with "Journey" blaring on the soundtrack? Hell - you've gotten this far - you might as well see how it ends!
